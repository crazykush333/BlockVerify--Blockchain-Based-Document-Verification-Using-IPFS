# BlockVerify--Blockchain-Based-Document-Verification-Using-IPFS
A decentralized web-based solution for tamper-proof document storage and verification. This application leverages smart contracts deployed on the Polygon blockchain and integrates with IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized file storage.

## 🚀 Highlights

🔐 Integrity-First: Hashes stored on-chain ensure document immutability

🌍 No Central Gatekeeper: Permissionless verification by design

⚡ Frictionless UX: Simplified upload/verify flow via connected MetaMask wallet

🗂️ Supports Many Formats: Upload PDFs, images, certificates, or other digital files

👨‍💼 Role-Based Access: Admin-exporter system for controlled submission

## ⚙️ System Prerequisites

Before you dive in, make sure you’ve got the essentials set up:

🧩 **Node.js & npm**  
  Core environment for running and building the project.  

🦊 **MetaMask Browser Extension**  
  For interacting with the blockchain directly from your browser.    

⛽ **Polygon Testnet Access**  
  You’ll need some free MATIC tokens for testing.  
 
🌀 **IPFS Client** *(Optional)*  
  Decentralized file storage tool — skip for now if IPFS isn't available.
